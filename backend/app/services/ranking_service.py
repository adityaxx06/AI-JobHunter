"""Ranking service: thin bridge from FastAPI to the worker pipeline (Phase 5.4).

Route -> this service -> existing worker ranking (repository + deterministic
scorer) -> database. No scoring logic lives here, no Gemini is ever called,
and no jobs are modified. The worker package is imported via a repo-root path
bootstrap so the backend reuses the exact Phase 5.3 pipeline (no duplication).
